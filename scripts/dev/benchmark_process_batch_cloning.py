"""
Benchmark the input-cloning overhead in `process_batch`'s entry point.

`process_batch` defensively clones `features`, `initial_feature_mask`, and
`initial_masked_features` on entry so that callers keep ownership of the
tensors they pass in. This script measures how much of end-to-end batch
evaluation time those three clones actually account for, on representative
workload sizes, to support an evidence-based decision on whether removing any
of them would be worthwhile. See docs/eval_input_cloning_assessment.md for
the recorded results and decision (GH issue #35).

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/dev/benchmark_process_batch_cloning.py
