# Documentation

User documentation follows [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/): every page is
exactly one of four types, and each type has its own folder. Put a new page
in the folder of its type, and when a page serves two types, split it.

| Folder | Type | A page here | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tutorials/` | Tutorial | Teaches a newcomer by walking them through a lesson they complete. | None yet. |
| `how-to/` | How-to guide | Tells a user with a goal what to do, as steps. No background beyond what a step needs; link to explanation instead. | `how-to/add_method.md` |
| `reference/` | Reference | Describes a thing (a file format, a command, a configuration option) completely and neutrally, for lookup. | `reference/release_manifest.md` |
| `explanation/` | Explanation | Says why: design reasons, trade-offs, limits, background. | `explanation/output_snapshots.md` |

Most AFABench users want to run the benchmark, not learn it, so most guides
are how-to guides. A how-to guide names its reader by one of the user types
in [`explanation/user_types.md`](explanation/user_types.md) and links to
that page rather than describing the reader itself.

Name a how-to guide after the task, with a verb (`create_output_snapshots.md`)
and its section headings after steps the reader performs. Name a
reference or explanation page after the thing it describes.

Two folders hold documents that are not user documentation and are outside
the Diátaxis types:

- `adr/`: architecture decision records (`docs/agents/domain.md`).
- `agents/`: how agents use the issue tracker, triage labels and domain
  docs.

Terms are defined in [`CONTEXT.md`](../CONTEXT.md); link to an entry there
instead of defining a term on a page.

### How-to guides

- Running the benchmark: [run the pipeline](how-to/run_the_pipeline.md),
  [run on SLURM](how-to/slurm_integration.md), choose hardware
  [per method](how-to/mixed_execution.md) and
  [for classifiers and pretrained models](how-to/prerequisite_execution.md),
  [CPU-only processing](how-to/cpu_processing_execution.md),
  [estimate the compute of a run](how-to/estimate_compute.md).
- Extending the benchmark: [add a dataset](how-to/add_dataset.md),
  [add a method](how-to/add_method.md).
- Using published results:
  [download published results](how-to/download_published_results.md),
  [compare your method with published results](how-to/compare_your_method_with_published_results.md).
- Maintaining releases:
  [create output snapshots](how-to/create_output_snapshots.md),
  [restore an output snapshot](how-to/restore_an_output_snapshot.md),
  [publish a benchmark release](how-to/publish_a_benchmark_release.md).
