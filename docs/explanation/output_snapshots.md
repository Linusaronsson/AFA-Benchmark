# Output snapshots

An output snapshot is a copy of everything the pipeline wrote under its
output root, made so it can be put back where Snakemake expects it. A
benchmark release is published from one. To make one, see
[create output snapshots](../how-to/create_output_snapshots.md); to put
it back, [restore an output snapshot](../how-to/restore_an_output_snapshot.md).

## A snapshot copies everything

A snapshot copies the whole output root as it is, including stale files no
current rule would produce (#39). It does not select by dataset, method or
output category; selection happens when downloading a published release
([`download`](../reference/snapshot_command.md#selection)). Its only
provenance is the release manifest, written only when it is saved with a
release id.

## Why a snapshot keeps mtimes

Snakemake decides whether an output is stale by comparing modification
times (mtimes): a file output by its own mtime, and a directory output by
the mtime of its `.snakemake_timestamp` file, or else of the directory
itself. A snapshot keeps the mtimes of every file and directory, including
the hidden `.snakemake_timestamp` files, so a tree in which no rule's
inputs were newer than its outputs is still so after being saved and
restored. Snakemake then reuses the restored outputs instead of producing
them again.

## Why a snapshot omits Snakemake metadata

A snapshot does not contain `.snakemake/metadata`, the record Snakemake
uses to rerun an output when its rule's code, parameters, input set or
software environment changed. Without it, a restored output is judged by
its mtime only. This is deliberate
([ADR 0003](../adr/0003-snapshots-omit-snakemake-metadata.md)):

- Every pipeline rule is a `shell:` rule, so Snakemake's code trigger
  hashes the shell command written in the `.smk` file, not the script it
  runs. That text changes for reasons unrelated to the output, such as a
  reformatted line.
- A repository adopter's fork moves on from the release's producing commit.
  With the metadata restored, such unrelated changes would make Snakemake
  rerun the published methods, which is the retraining reference methods
  exist to avoid, and an automatic compatibility check that #36 decided
  against.

The consequence: after restoring a snapshot into a checkout where a rule's
code or parameters changed, a dry run does not notice. Delete or
regenerate that rule's outputs yourself.
